A tutorial for registering a Google Cloud project for those who are new to [GEE](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) ðŸŒŽ

## Description: Why do I need this?
**Scenario:** *You are new to GEE. You have just signed up, but you don't know how to create a Google Cloud project for use with GEE. Below, this tutorial walks you through the step-by-step process for doing so.* ðŸ˜‰

## Required software

1. You will need to have signed up for GEE, **preferably using your personal [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/) account**, as many institutions usually stop their personnel from being able to create [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) projects. You can sign up for GEE at https://earthengine.google.com/signup/.
   
2. I also **highly recommend** that you use the [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for the registration process and for GEE use.

## Notes

Ujaval Gandhi of [SpatialThoughts](https://spatialthoughts.com) has *also* published instructions for how to register a Google Cloud project for use with GEE: https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/gee-sign-up.html. This guide should be complementary to those instructions. It should also be noted that Google also updated their Google Cloud project registration procedure in June 2025, so the following should be current to that last update.

To see these instructions as a slide deck, see: https://bit.ly/gee_project_reg.

## Workflow (suggested)

1. These tutorials were developed for the NASA EarthData webinar on the [Fundamentals of Hyperspectral and Thermal Earth Observations](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/events/fundamentals-use-hyperspectral-thermal-nasa-earth-observations), on 21-22 July 2025.

2. The first step toward creating a Google Cloud Project for GEE is to visit the GEE Code Editor: https://code.earthengine.google.com. If you are new to GEE or haven't yet registered a project, you will find a screen similar to the one below, where you will be asked to either (a) register a new project [which the following instructions will walk you through], or (b) to authorize an existing cloud project.

3. Since this tutorial is focused on creating and registering *new* Google Cloud projects, we will select the blue button that says, "I want to register a new project." As a reminder, you will want to be using your personal Gmail account, as many institutions do not allow creating Google Cloud projects. If you have logged in using your institutional email address, I recommend that you re-login using your personal Gmail account in order to proceed.

4. Next, you will be taken to a new tab, where you will begin creating a Google Cloud project.

The first step in the process is naming a project, so you will need to enter a project name in the first box under **Project name**. Since these instructions are focused on the NASA EarthData training webinar, one name you could use is **nasa-training-2025-07** but you can select any name you prefer in so long as it does not violate the naming convention Google allows. If you do select a name with characters that are not permitted, you will be informed that the project name is not compliant and you will be asked to choose a new project name.

By default, the **Location** option has *No organization* selected, and that is fine. To proceed, you will need to click the blue **Create** button at the bottom left.

5. After your project has been created, you will be asked to register it. You should also notice that the project name is now listed at the top left, to the left of the *Google Cloud* logo. Go ahead and click the **Register** button.

6. After your project has been registered, you will be asked to select whether it is for *commercial* or *non-commercial*. Since you are creating this project for the NASA EarthData training webinar, that qualifies for non-commercial use. You will therefore want to click the **Get started** button at the bottom to proceed.

7. In the following steps, you will provide information about your use of this Google Cloud project and how it qualifies for *non-commercial* use. The first step asks you to **Select your organization type**, and for this, we will choose **Earth Engine trainer or trainee**, since you will be a trainee.

8. After selecting **Earth Engine trainer or trainee**, you will need to select **Next**.

9. Under the **Check noncommercial elegibility** option, you should select **participant**, Since the training is from 21-22 July, you sould select **21 July 2025** as the start date, and **22 July 2025** as the end date of the training.

10. After you have selected the dates, click **Next** to continue.

11. Since no pricing plan is required as this training is a *non-commercial* activity, under the 3rd option for **Choose your plan**, select **Next**.

12. Under the 4th part (**Describe your work**), you will next need to select a basic description of what you intend to work on.

![](https://github.com/BzGEO/GEE_resources/blob/main/tutorials/_graphics/Slide13.PNG)

13. For instance, depending on what you are currently working on and what you plan to explore during the training. For instance, you might select the **Protection & conservation** option under **Does your work with Earth Engine fall into any of these categories?** Then, under **Will you use Earth Engine for any of the following?** you can select **Oceans Ecosystems & Conservation** if that is appropriate. If not, feel free to select another option that best fits how you plan to use GEE during the training.

14. After you have made the appropriate selections under **Describe your work**, click the **Next** button.

15. You will be asked to review all of the responses you have provided for sections 1-4. If you are fine with the summary (section 5), you can click the **Register** button at the bottom to finalize the process.

![](https://github.com/BzGEO/GEE_resources/blob/main/tutorials/_graphics/Slide16.PNG)

16. You will next see a message indicating that the Earth Engine API needs to be enabled. Click the **Enable** link at the bottom right of the message shown.

![](https://github.com/BzGEO/GEE_resources/blob/main/tutorials/_graphics/Slide17.PNG)

17. You will next be shown the Google Cloud configuration page that indicates that your project is registered for non-commercial use. You can now return to the [GEE Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com) tab. You *may* need to refresh it so that it recognizes that you have a registered cloud project.

![](https://github.com/BzGEO/GEE_resources/blob/main/tutorials/_graphics/Slide18.PNG)

18. Upon returning to the [GEE Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/), you will have the option to **Choose a Cloud Project for your workspace**. Under the **Project** pulldown, you will see a list of **Earth Engine enabled Cloud Projects**, and you should see the name of the project you created. [In this case, you can see that I have multiple projects registered.]

![](https://github.com/BzGEO/GEE_resources/blob/main/tutorials/_graphics/Slide19.PNG)

19. After you select the project you created, click the blue **Select** button in the bottom right of the dialog.

20. Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ With that, you are now ready to start using the GEE Code Editor! ðŸ˜‰
